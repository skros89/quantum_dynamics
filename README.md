## quantum_dynamics
Quantum Dynamics project by Selwyn Rosenstand for the course Computational Physics. The time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation has been solved in 1 dimension using both the Crank-Nicolson method and the split-operator scheme, and in 2 dimensions using the split-operator scheme. Units have been chosen so $\hbar=2m=1$.
