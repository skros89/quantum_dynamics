## quantum_dynamics
Quantum Dynamics project by Selwyn Rosenstand for the course on Computational Physics. The time-dependent SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger equation has been solved in 1 dimension using both the Crank-Nicolson method and the split-operator scheme, and in 2 dimensions using the split-operator scheme. Units have been chosen such that $\hbar=2m=1$. Animation results have been added as seperate files, because the simulation could take some time.
